Library Project

The Library Project is a web application that allows users to browse and search for books in a virtual library. It provides an intuitive interface for users to explore a collection of books, apply filters, and view detailed information about each book.

Features:
- Infinite scrolling: The application uses infinite scrolling to load books dynamically as the user scrolls through the library, providing a seamless browsing experience.
- Filter functionality: Users can apply various filters such as title, author, minimum pages, and publish year to narrow down their search and find books that match their preferences.
- Responsive design: The user interface is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, allowing users to access the library on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Theme customization: The application supports light and dark themes, providing users with the option to choose their preferred theme for a personalized experience.
- Modal dialog: An information modal dialog is available to provide additional details or instructions to the user when needed.

Technologies Used:
- React: The project is built using the React library, which provides a modular and efficient way to create user interfaces.
- Axios: Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the server and retrieve book data.
- React Infinite Scroll Component: The React Infinite Scroll Component is utilized to implement the infinite scrolling feature, loading more books as the user scrolls.
- Material-UI: Material-UI is used for styling and UI components, providing a modern and visually appealing design.
- Lodash: Lodash is incorporated to add debouncing functionality to the filter inputs, reducing unnecessary API requests and enhancing performance.

This project demonstrates the usage of popular front-end technologies to create a dynamic and responsive library application. It showcases the implementation of key features such as infinite scrolling and filtering, providing an interactive and efficient user experience.

Feel free to explore the library, apply filters, and discover your next favorite book!
